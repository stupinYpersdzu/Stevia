## Poetic Techniques and Devices
 
Williams employs a variety of poetic techniques and devices to convey his message and engage his readers. Some of these include:
 
- **Alliteration**: The repetition of consonant sounds at the beginning of words or syllables. For example, "the sun sets sending shards of light" (Cycle 1), "the greatest Americans have not been born yet" (Cycle 2), "the kiss that killed me was softer than sin" (Cycle 3).
- **Assonance**: The repetition of vowel sounds within words or syllables. For example, "a kiss that distorts his highest and lowest frequencies" (Cycle 1), "I am not afraid to die I'm afraid I'll survive" (Cycle 4), "she is the sum of everything I've ever loved" (Cycle 5).
- **Enjambment**: The continuation of a sentence or phrase across a line break without punctuation. For example, "I am not afraid to die / I'm afraid I'll survive / and have to watch you surrender / your life" (Cycle 4), "she is not human / she is humanity / she is not a woman / she is every woman" (Cycle 5), "she kissed me / as if she alone could forge / synthesis between / Aspirin and Migraine" (Cycle 6).
- **Imagery**: The use of vivid and descriptive language to create pictures in the reader's mind. For example, "her lips were wet with venom / when she placed them on my brow / her eyes were like the lotus / that unfold before the sun" (Cycle 3), "her tongue was like a serpent's / it split me down the spine / it opened up my chakras / we became one mind" (Cycle 6), "she was like a star falling from heaven / burning up in the atmosphere / she was like a flower blooming in the desert / giving hope to all who thirsted there" (Cycle 7).
- **Metaphor**: A comparison between two things that are not alike but have something in common. For example, "she was my religion / she was my church / she was heaven on earth" (Cycle 3), "she was like a bullet / that entered through my heart / she was like a virus / that infected every part" (Cycle 6), "she was like a revolution / that toppled every throne / she was like a revelation / that made us all atone" (Cycle 7).
- **Personification**: The attribution of human qualities or characteristics to non-human things or concepts. For example, "the sun sets sending shards of light that shatter in our eyes" (Cycle 1), "the moon rises casting shadows that dance upon our skin" (Cycle 2), "the wind whispers secrets that only we can hear" (Cycle 3).
- **Repetition**: The use of the same word or phrase more than once for emphasis or effect. For example, "please give blood please give blood please give blood please give blood please give blood please give blood please give blood please give blood please give blood please give blood please give blood please give blood please give blood please give blood please give blood please give blood please give blood please give blood please give blood please give blood please give blood please give blood please give blood please give blood please give blood please give blood please give blood please give blood please give blood" (Cycle
