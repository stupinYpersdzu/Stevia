# How to Download IEC 60826:2017 - The International Standard for Overhead Transmission Lines Design Criteria
  
IEC 60826:2017 is the latest edition of the international standard that specifies the loading and strength requirements of overhead transmission lines derived from reliability-based design principles. These requirements apply to lines 45 kV and above, but can also be applied to lines with a lower nominal voltage. The standard also provides a framework for the preparation of national standards dealing with overhead transmission lines, using reliability concepts and employing probabilistic or semi-probabilistic methods.

The redline version will help you understand the main technical changes that have been made in the fourth edition of IEC 60826:2017, such as:

- The simplification of the standard by removing many informative annexes and theoretical details that can now be found in CIGRE Technical Brochure 178 and referred to as needed in the text of the standard.
- The revisions that reflect the users experience in the application of the standard, together with information about amplification of wind speed due to escarpments.
- The updates of the annexes dealing with icing data using new work by CIGRE.

By downloading both the standard and the redline version, you can have a comprehensive and comparative view of the design criteria of overhead transmission lines according to IEC 60826:2017.
