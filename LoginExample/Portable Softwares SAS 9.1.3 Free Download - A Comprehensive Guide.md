SAS is a powerful statistical analysis software that can handle large and complex data sets, perform various types of analyses, and create professional reports and graphs. However, SAS is also expensive and requires a license to use. If you want to try SAS without installing it or paying for it, you can use SAS 9.1.3 Portable, which is a single executable file that runs on most Windows systems.

In this article, we will show you how to download and run SAS 9.1.3 Portable for free, and what are some of the limitations and advantages of using it.
 
## How to Download SAS 9.1.3 Portable
 
SAS 9.1.3 Portable is not an official product of SAS Institute, but a modified version created by some users who gathered up the bits and pieces of SAS 9.1.3 torrents and applied a patch to make it work[^1^]. Therefore, you will not find it on the SAS website or any other official source. Instead, you will have to search for it on some torrent sites or file-sharing platforms.
 
One possible source is Bitbucket, where a user named oil99 uploaded a link to download SAS 9.1.3 Portable[^1^]. However, this link may not be reliable or safe, as it may contain viruses or malware. Therefore, you should always scan any file you download from unknown sources with an antivirus software before opening it.
 
Another possible source is a blog called Tsoftwares411, where a user named MakoShark2 posted a link to download SAS 9.1.3 Portable[^2^]. This link seems to be more trustworthy, as it directs to a Google Drive folder that contains the file and some instructions on how to use it. However, this link may also be taken down or blocked at any time, so you should download it as soon as possible if you want to use it.
 
## How to Run SAS 9.1.3 Portable
 
Once you have downloaded the file, which is about 460 MB in size, you can run it by double-clicking on it or right-clicking and choosing "Run as administrator". You do not need to install anything or enter any license information, as the file is already patched to bypass the expiration date of the original SAS 9.1.3 license[^2^]. However, you do need to have Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed and updated on your system, as SAS 9.1.3 requires Java to run[^2^]. You can download JRE from [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/).
 
When you run SAS 9.1.3 Portable for the first time, you may see some warning messages or errors, such as "Unable to load sasexe.dll" or "Unable to load sasmsg.dll". These are normal and can be ignored by clicking "OK" or "Continue"[^2^]. You may also see some messages about updating your Java version or installing some components, which you can also ignore or cancel.
 
After a few seconds, you should see the SAS splash screen and then the main window of SAS 9.1.3, where you can start using the software as usual. You can open existing data sets or create new ones, write and run SAS programs, perform analyses, and generate reports and graphs.
