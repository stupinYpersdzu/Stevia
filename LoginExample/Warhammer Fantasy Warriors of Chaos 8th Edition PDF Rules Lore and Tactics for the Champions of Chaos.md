## Background
 
The Warriors of Chaos army book provides an overview of the history, culture, and beliefs of the Chaos worshippers, as well as their goals and motivations. The book describes how the Chaos Wastes, a region of constant turmoil and mutation in the far north of the world, is the source of all evil and corruption. It also explains how the four Chaos gods - Khorne, the god of blood and war; Nurgle, the god of disease and decay; Tzeentch, the god of change and magic; and Slaanesh, the god of pleasure and excess - vie for dominance and influence over their mortal followers. The book also introduces some of the most notorious champions of Chaos, such as Archaon, the Everchosen, who leads the End Times; Galrauch, the first Chaos dragon; Sigvald the Magnificent, a vain and decadent warrior; Valkia the Bloody, a fearsome shieldmaiden of Khorne; and Throgg, the Troll King.
