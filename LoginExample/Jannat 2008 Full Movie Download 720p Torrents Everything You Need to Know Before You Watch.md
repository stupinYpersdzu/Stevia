The movie has some thrilling moments and twists that keep the audience engaged. The performances of the actors are also commendable. Emraan Hashmi delivers a convincing portrayal of a flawed but charismatic character who is torn between his love and his lust for money. Sonal Chauhan makes an impressive debut as the innocent and beautiful Zoya who tries to reform Arjun. Javed Sheikh is menacing as the ruthless don who uses Arjun as his pawn. Sameer Kochhar is effective as the honest and brave cop who chases Arjun.
 
The movie also has some flaws that hamper its impact. The movie focuses more on the romance than on the crime aspect, which makes it lose its edge and pace. The movie also has some clichÃ©d dialogues and scenes that seem unrealistic and melodramatic. The climax of the movie is also predictable and disappointing.
 
Overall, Jannat is a movie that has its moments of entertainment and excitement, but also suffers from some drawbacks that prevent it from being a memorable and gripping thriller. It is a movie that can be watched once for its music, performances and theme, but not for its execution and logic.
