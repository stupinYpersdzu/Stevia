## How to Enable Console Commands
 
To begin using these commands, you need to set a launch parameter for the next time your game is launched. To do this, follow these steps:
 
1. Navigate to your COH2 game in the Steam Library, right click on it and select properties.
2. In the tab that opens up, you should see an option to set launch parameters. Open this and when prompted enter in the following code: `-dev`
3. Press Ok/Save and you're ready to launch the game.

## How to Use Console Commands
 
Following this, load up a new or saved campaign mission or whatever you look to cheat in, and open the console by pressing Control-Shift-Tilde (Ctrl+Shift+`/~). This will open up your console, and now you can either enter the codes manually or copy/paste them in. Here are some of the codes:

- `FOW_RevealAll` --- Toggles the fog of war/ Allows you to see whole map and units.
- `Player_SetResource (Game_GetLocalPlayer (), RT_Manpower, 9999)` - Adds 9999 Manpower
- `Player_SetResource (Game_GetLocalPlayer (), RT_Munition, 9999)` - Adds 9999 Munition
- `Player_SetResource (Game_GetLocalPlayer (), RT_Fuel, 9999)` - Adds 9999 Fuel
- `Player_SetResource (Game_GetLocalPlayer (), RT_Command, 5)` - Adds 5 Command points (Beware, add only the amount you need for all abilities, so it's best that you count them first, then you can paste this command in and change the value from 5 to whatever amount you need)
- `Player_SetPopCapOverride (Game_GetLocalPlayer (), 1000)` - Makes your pop-cap larger

There are other cheats for this game, but these are the basics. You can find more codes in this guide[^1^] or this discussion[^2^]. Have fun cheating your way through those pesky campaign and AI skirmishes!

## How to Improve Your Skills in Company of Heroes 2
 
Company of Heroes 2 is a challenging and rewarding real-time strategy game that requires a lot of skill and practice to master. If you are new to the game or want to improve your performance, here are some tips and tricks that can help you become a better commander.
 
### Learn the Game Modes and Victory Conditions
 
Company of Heroes 2 offers different game modes and victory conditions that require different strategies and tactics. The main game modes are:

- Annihilation: The goal is to destroy all enemy buildings or wipe out all enemy units.
- Victory Point Control: The goal is to capture and hold more victory points than the enemy until their score reaches zero.
- Sector Control: The goal is to capture and hold more sectors than the enemy until their score reaches zero.
- Breakthrough: The goal is to capture and hold a specific sector on the enemy's side of the map.

Each game mode has its own challenges and opportunities, so you need to adapt your strategy accordingly. For example, in Annihilation mode, you need to focus on destroying enemy buildings and units, while in Victory Point Control mode, you need to focus on capturing and defending key points on the map. You also need to pay attention to the map layout, terrain features, weather effects, and resource points that can affect your gameplay.
 
### Manage Your Resources Wisely
 
Resources are essential for building units, structures, upgrades, and abilities in Company of Heroes 2. There are three types of resources: Manpower, Munitions, and Fuel. You can gain resources by capturing and holding resource points on the map, or by using certain abilities or doctrines. You can also lose resources by losing units, structures, or resource points.
 
You need to balance your resource income and expenditure carefully, as each resource has its own importance and trade-offs. For example, Manpower is needed for building infantry units and reinforcing squads, but it also affects your population cap and unit upkeep. Munitions are needed for using abilities and upgrades that enhance your combat effectiveness, but they also limit your ability to build more units. Fuel is needed for building vehicles and tanks, but it also affects your tech level and unit production speed.

You should always try to have enough resources for your current and future needs, but not too much that you waste them or lose them to the enemy. You should also try to deny your enemy's resources by capturing or destroying their resource points or cutting off their supply lines.
 
### Use Cover and Flanking
 
Cover and flanking are two of the most important concepts in Company of Heroes 2's combat system. Cover is a feature that reduces the damage taken by units from enemy fire. There are three types of cover: green (heavy), yellow (light), and red (negative). Green cover provides the most protection, yellow cover provides some protection, and red cover increases the damage taken. Cover is directional, meaning that it only works if the enemy is firing from the opposite direction of the cover. You can see the cover status of your units by looking at the shield icon above them.
 
Flanking is a tactic that involves attacking an enemy from their sides or rear, where they have less or no cover. Flanking can increase your damage output, reduce your damage taken, suppress or pin down enemy units, or force them to retreat. Flanking can be done by using infantry squads, vehicles, tanks, or artillery. You can see if your units are flanking or being flanked by looking at the arrow icon above them.
 
You should always try to use cover and flanking to your advantage in combat situations. You should position your units in green or yellow cover whenever possible, and avoid red cover or open areas. You should also try to flank your enemies whenever possible, especially if they are in cover or have superior firepower. You should also watch out for enemy flanking attempts and reposition your units accordingly.
 
### Use Combined Arms
 
Combined arms is a strategy that involves using different types of units together to achieve greater synergy and effectiveness. Each unit type has its own strengths and weaknesses, and can complement or counter other unit types. For example:

- Infantry units are versatile and mobile, but vulnerable to machine guns, mortars, 8cf37b1e13
