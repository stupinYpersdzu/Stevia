Public administration is not only a subject of academic interest but also a practical skill that is essential for anyone who wants to work in the public sector. Whether it is civil services, public enterprises, NGOs, or international organisations, public administration knowledge and skills can help one perform better and achieve greater impact. Public administration can also help one understand the functioning of the government and its policies, and participate in democratic processes as an informed citizen.
 
However, public administration is not a static or monolithic subject. It is constantly evolving and adapting to the changing needs and challenges of the society. Therefore, it is important for students and professionals of public administration to keep themselves updated with the latest developments and trends in the field.

- Public finance and budgeting: This involves understanding the sources and uses of public funds, and the processes and techniques of budgeting and financial management in the public sector. It also involves evaluating the fiscal policies and their impact on the economy and society.
- Public service delivery and innovation: This involves designing and implementing effective and efficient ways of delivering public goods and services to the citizens. It also involves fostering a culture of innovation and creativity in the public sector to address the emerging needs and challenges.
