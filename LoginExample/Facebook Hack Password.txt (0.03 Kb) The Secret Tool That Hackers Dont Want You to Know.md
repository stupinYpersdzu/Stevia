# How to Hack Facebook Passwords with a Simple Text File
 
Have you ever wondered how hackers can break into someone's Facebook account and steal their personal information? Well, one of the methods they use is called **brute force attack**, which involves trying different combinations of passwords until they find the right one. This may sound impossible, but it can be done with a simple text file that contains a list of common passwords.

In this article, we will show you how to use a text file called `Facebook Hack Password.txt (0.03 Kb)` to hack Facebook passwords. This file contains 10 million passwords that are frequently used by Facebook users. You can download it from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/IAmBlackHacker/Facebook-BruteForce/blob/master/passwords.txt) [^1^]. However, before you proceed, you should know that this is illegal and unethical, and you may face serious consequences if you get caught.

- A computer with an internet connection.
- A Python interpreter installed on your computer. You can download it from [the official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- A text editor to write and edit your Python code. You can use any editor you like, such as Notepad, Sublime Text, or Visual Studio Code.
- A Facebook account that you want to hack. You will need to know the email address or the profile ID of the target account.
- A proxy server to hide your IP address and avoid detection. You can find free proxy servers online, such as [this list](https://www.proxynova.com/proxy-server-list/).

## How It Works
 
The basic idea behind hacking Facebook passwords with a text file is to use a Python script that performs a brute force attack on the target account. The script will try each password from the text file until it finds the correct one or reaches the end of the file. The script will also use a proxy server to avoid being blocked by Facebook's security measures.
 
The script will use two modules: `requests` and `bs4`. The `requests` module will allow us to send HTTP requests to Facebook's login page and check the response. The `bs4` module will allow us to parse the HTML code of the response and look for errors or success messages.
 
The script will also use two arguments: `-t` and `-w`. The `-t` argument will specify the target email address or profile ID of the Facebook account we want to hack. The `-w` argument will specify the path of the text file that contains the passwords.
 
The script will also use an optional argument: `-p`. The `-p` argument will specify the proxy server we want to use in the format of IP:PORT.
 
## The Code
 
Here is the Python code for hacking Facebook passwords with a text file:
  ```python # Importing modules import requests import sys import bs4  # Defining arguments target = sys.argv[2] wordlist = sys.argv[4] proxy = sys.argv[6] if len(sys.argv) == 7 else None  # Defining constants login\_url = "https://www.facebook.com/login.php" user\_agent = "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/96.0.4664.110 Safari/537.36"  # Defining headers headers =      "User-Agent": user\_agent   # Defining proxies proxies = {     "http": f"http://{ 8cf37b1e13
