The stamps of the German Empire are highly collectible and offer a fascinating insight into the history and culture of Germany during a turbulent period. Some of the most notable stamps from this era include:

- The Vineta provisional, a rare stamp that was issued by the cruiser SMS Vineta in 1901, when it ran out of stamps while stationed in Jamaica. The stamp was created by cutting a 10-pfennig Germania stamp in half and overprinting it with \"5 Pfenning\" and \"Vineta\".
- The Germania stamps issued in China, Morocco, and Turkey, which were overprinted with the name of the country and the local currency. These stamps were used by the German post offices abroad until the outbreak of World War I.
- The Germania stamps issued in occupied territories during World War I, which were overprinted with various inscriptions to indicate the area of administration. Some of these stamps are very scarce and sought-after by collectors.
- The Germania stamps issued in Saarland, Allenstein, Marienwerder, Memel, and Danzig after World War I, which were overprinted with different names or symbols to reflect the political status of these regions. These stamps document the aftermath of the war and the plebiscites that determined their fate.

The Germania stamps were replaced by the Weimar Republic stamps in 1923, which featured new designs and values to cope with the hyperinflation that plagued Germany at that time. The Germania stamps, however, remain a popular and rewarding field of philately that showcases the diversity and complexity of German history.
