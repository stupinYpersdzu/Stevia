One of them is the bootleg album *Burst Into A Rage*, which captures the Scorpions live in Cologne, Germany on April 26, 1975. This was a time when the band was still experimenting with their sound and style, and had a different lineup than the classic one that would later produce hits like *Rock You Like a Hurricane* and *Wind of Change*.
  
The bootleg album features 10 tracks, including an instrumental intro, a cover of Jimi Hendrix's *Red House*, and some songs that would later appear on their studio albums *Fly to the Rainbow* and *In Trance*. The band also plays some songs that were never released on any official album, such as *Rock'n'Roll Queen* and *This Is My Song*.
  
The performance is energetic, raw, and powerful, showcasing the talent and charisma of the band members. The guitar work of Uli Jon Roth is especially impressive, as he delivers some stunning solos and riffs. The vocals of Klaus Meine are also strong and expressive, while the rhythm section of Francis Buchholz (bass), Doobie Fechter (drums), and Rudolf Schenker (guitar) provides a solid foundation.
  
The bootleg album is a rare gem for any fan of the Scorpions or hard rock in general. It gives a glimpse into the early history of the band, before they became global stars. It also shows how they evolved from a psychedelic rock band to a heavy metal powerhouse.
  
If you want to listen to this amazing live performance, you can find it online on various websites[^1^] [^2^] [^3^]. You can also read more about it on some blogs and webzines[^1^] [^2^]. You won't regret it!
  
The bootleg album *Burst Into A Rage* is not only a great document of the Scorpions' live performance, but also a rare piece of rock history. It was recorded at a time when the Scorpions were opening for The Sweet, a British glam rock band that was very popular in Europe at the time[^1^]. The Scorpions were still relatively unknown outside of Germany, but they were determined to make an impression on the audience and the music industry.
  
The show was broadcasted by WDR, a German public radio station that was known for promoting rock music and supporting new bands[^1^]. The broadcast helped the Scorpions gain more exposure and recognition, as well as some loyal fans who were impressed by their music and performance. Some of these fans later became famous musicians themselves, such as Michael Schenker (Uli Jon Roth's brother and former guitarist of UFO), Matthias Jabs (who would join the Scorpions in 1978), and Steve Harris (founder and bassist of Iron Maiden).
