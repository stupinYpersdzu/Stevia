The album opens with "The Entrance", a short instrumental track that sets the tone for the rest of the album. The next track, "Starlight Parade", is one of the band's most popular songs, and for good reason. It is a cheerful and upbeat song that celebrates the joy of life and dreams. The chorus is catchy and infectious, and the bridge features a rap by Fukase, the band's vocalist and leader.
 
The third track, "Fantasy", is another fan favorite, and was used as the theme song for the live-action film adaptation of the manga "Ninomiya-kun". It is a whimsical and playful song that expresses the band's love for fantasy stories and imagination. The song has a catchy hook and a catchy chorus that will make you want to sing along.
 
The fourth track, "illusion", is a darker and more mysterious song that explores the theme of deception and lies. It has a haunting melody and a hypnotic beat that creates a sense of suspense and intrigue. The lyrics are cryptic and ambiguous, leaving room for interpretation.
 
The fifth track, "Phoenix", is a powerful and epic song that depicts the band's determination and resilience. It has a soaring melody and a dramatic orchestration that creates a sense of grandeur and heroism. The lyrics are inspirational and motivational, encouraging listeners to rise from the ashes and overcome any obstacles.
 
The sixth track, "Angels and Demons", is a contrastive song that explores the duality of human nature. It has a simple melody and a minimalistic arrangement that creates a stark contrast between the verses and the chorus. The verses are sung by Fukase in a low voice, representing the dark side of humanity, while the chorus is sung by Saori, the band's keyboardist and female vocalist, in a high voice, representing the light side of humanity.
 
The seventh track, "Love the warz", is a controversial song that criticizes the state of the world and the human condition. It has a heavy rock sound and an aggressive tone that creates a sense of anger and frustration. The lyrics are sarcastic and cynical, denouncing war, violence, greed, corruption, and hypocrisy.
 
The eighth track, "Never Ending World", is a hopeful song that expresses the band's vision for a better future. It has a bright pop sound and an optimistic tone that creates a sense of hope and positivity. The lyrics are idealistic and utopian, envisioning a world where people live in harmony and peace.
