Pharmacognosy is the study of natural products derived from plants, animals, fungi and microorganisms that have medicinal or biological activity. It is a branch of pharmacy that deals with the identification, extraction, isolation, purification, characterization, biosynthesis, pharmacology and clinical use of these natural products.
 
One of the classic textbooks of pharmacognosy is "Pharmacognosy" by Varro E. Tyler, Lynn R. Brady and James E. Robbers. The first edition of this book was published in 1956 by Lea & Febiger, and the latest edition (the ninth) was published in 2009 by CRC Press.
