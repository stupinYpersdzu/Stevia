If you have a Toyota car with a NDDN-W58 navigation system, you may have encountered a problem where the system asks you to insert a correct map disc. This can happen if the battery is disconnected or replaced, or if the system is corrupted by a virus or malware. The system will not function properly until you insert the original map disc that came with the car.

However, if you have lost or damaged your map disc, or if you bought your car from another country and the map disc is not compatible with your region, you may need to find another solution. Fortunately, there is a way to unlock your NDDN-W58 navigation system without the original map disc. You can download a boot program disc from the internet and burn it on a DVD-R disc. This disc will bypass the map disc check and allow you to use your navigation system normally.
 
Here are the steps to unlock your NDDN-W58 navigation system:
 
1. Download the boot program disc file from this link: [https://navigationdiskjp.com/product/nddn-w58-2/](https://navigationdiskjp.com/product/nddn-w58-2/). This is a trusted website that provides map disc solutions for various Toyota models.
2. Burn the file on a DVD-R disc using a software like ImgBurn. Make sure you select the lowest possible speed and verify the disc after burning.
3. Insert the DVD-R disc into your NDDN-W58 navigation system and turn on the ignition. The system will load the boot program and display a message saying "Please wait".
4. After a few minutes, the system will restart and show the normal menu. You can now eject the DVD-R disc and use your navigation system as usual.
5.
