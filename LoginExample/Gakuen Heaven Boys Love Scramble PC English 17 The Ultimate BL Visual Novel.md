- A 3D design and visualization tool that supports bi-directional STEP model import and export, allowing users to view and verify their PCB design in 3D and in the context of the mechanical elements[^1^].
- A learning module that provides interactive tutorials and videos to help users learn how to use PSpice, the circuit simulation tool of OrCAD[^3^].
- A design reuse tool that helps users save time and effort by reusing existing design elements such as symbols, footprints, constraints, netlists, etc.

## OrCAD 16.6: A Reliable and High-Performance PCB Design Software
 
OrCAD 16.6 is not only a user-friendly and customizable PCB design software, but also a reliable and high-performance one. It offers a robust and accurate simulation engine that helps users verify and optimize their PCB designs before fabrication. It also offers a fast and efficient layout engine that helps users place and route their PCB designs with ease and precision.
 
One of the key features of OrCAD 16.6 is the PSpice simulation tool that improves user productivity by providing simulation convergence improvements and an average 20 percent gain in simulation speed[^2^]. These significant performance gains are achieved through the introduction of multi-core support for simulations involving large designs and designs dominated by complex models such as MOSFETs and BJTs[^2^]. PSpice also supports mixed-signal simulation, advanced analysis, parametric sweep, Monte Carlo analysis, etc.
 
Another key feature of OrCAD 16.6 is the constraint manager that allows users to define and manage design rules and constraints across schematic and layout domains. This ensures consistency and quality of the PCB design throughout the design process. The constraint manager also supports hierarchical constraints, differential pairs, length matching, impedance control, etc.
